# Python_Lista-De-Gastos
This project was created as an evaluation method, in Pyhon chair.

College: Cesar - School

With the aim of creating a program where registered users could store simple information, such as:

- Where did he spend the money?
- The amount spent.
- Date the expense was incurred

You can change, delete or check the information after it is registered.

===============================================

  The project was created in a simple way, but in the future, perhaps I will make changes to improve it
